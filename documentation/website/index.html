  <h1>NaYaBoh - Speed up your Internet!</h1>

  <p style="font-style: italic;"><a href="index_de.html">(Deutsch /
  German)</a></p>

  <p>NaYaBoh is an Internet Proxy and Gateway, especially designed
  to be easy to use.<br /></p>

  <p>NaYaBoh is opensource software and thus free for you to
  use.<br /></p>

  <p>NaYaBoh helps you if you share an expensive and/or slow
  Internet connection among several computers. See some examples
  where NaYaBoh can be of help:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cyber-Cafe in a developing country</li>

    <li>School in a remote area</li>

    <li>Office with slow modem</li>
  </ul>

  <p>NaYaBoh does no magic. It uses common techniques which are
  well known to computer engineers. NaYaBoh allows you to benefit
  of this techniques without being such a specialist. If you
  install NaYaBoh, it will try to figure out a good setup for you
  and do it's job silently. To give you an idea how NaYaBoh is
  helping you, let me list it very briefly:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Caching visited websites for a faster access next time</li>

    <li>Blocking unwanted advertisement</li>

    <li>Caching IP to Name translation (DNS-Requests)</li>

    <li>Configuring all your computers network access
    automatically</li>

    <li>Give you control over the access of each computer</li>

    <li>Help you detect virus infected computers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Enough talking for now... lets look at a picture.</p>

  <pre class="imgtxt">
Installation in an IT-Centre in Buea, Cameroon. About 30 Windows clients online simultaneously.<br />
</pre>

  <p>On the Y-axis left you see the time. The two graphs indicate
  how long it needed to download a website. The red line is the
  normal Internet connection, the green line is the one which is
  enhanced using NaYaBoh. You will see that Internet is much faster
  with NaYaBoh, since the green line is lower. You will be able to
  produce such a measurement for you own environment with a simple
  click, after installing NaYaBoh. So that you can see your own
  benefit.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p>I started developing NaYaBoh during my stay in Cameroon. So I
  named it in the Pidgin language, a widely used westafrican
  dialect. In this dialect "na ya boh" can be translated with "this
  is your friend". It is definitely a fitting name for this piece
  of software!<br /></p>

  <p>Send me some of your benchmark pictures and information about
  your location and how many computers you have connected. I would
  like to hear from you!<br /></p>
