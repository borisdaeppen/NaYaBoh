<div><img class="center" src="pics/nayaboh_benchmark_example.png" width="800" height="400" alt="NaYaBoh Benchmark"/></div>
<pre class="imgtxt">Installation in an IT-Centre in Buea, Cameroon. About 30 Windows clients online simultaneously.</pre>
<p>On the Y-axis left you see the time. The two graphs indicate how long it needed to download a website.
The red line is the normal Internet connection, the green line is the one which is enhanced using NaYaBoh.
You will see that Internet is much faster with NaYaBoh, since the green line is lower.
You will be able to produce such a measurement for you own environment with a simple click, after installing NaYaBoh.
So that you can see your own benefit.

<h2>History and Feedback</h2>
<p>I started developing NaYaBoh during my stay in Cameroon.
So I named it in the Pidgin language, a widely used westafrican dialect.
In this dialect "na ya boh" can be translated with "this is your friend".
It is definitely a fitting name for this piece of software!</p>
