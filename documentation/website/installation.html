  <h1>NaYaBoh - Installation</h1>

  <h2>How can I get it?</h2>

  <p>NaYaBoh is completely free to use. This is so because all it's
  parts are licensed under open source licenses. If you want to
  learn more about open source you can start reading here: <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a> and <a href=
  "http://opensource.org/">http://opensource.org/</a></p>

  <p>To run NaYaBoh you need the following things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A computer with two network cards.</li>

    <li>Operating System: Ubuntu (or any Debian GNU/Linux)</li>

    <li>The NaYaBoh package</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Where can you get this things from?</p>

  <h3>Computer</h3>

  <p>With the computer I can not help you. I can just tell you that
  it can be any ordinary old computer. The only requirement is that
  there are two network cards.</p>

  "Example of NaYaBoh hardware used in Limbe" /></div>
  <pre class="imgtxt">
Example of NaYaBoh hardware used in Limbe<br />
</pre>

  <p>See this example, it was send to me from a school in Limbe,
  Cameroon. They installed NaYaBoh on a mini itx board (<a href=
  "http://www.pcengines.ch">www.pcengines.ch</a>) which consumes
  only 5 watts. The operating system is on a 1 GB flash device. The
  board has only one Ethernet card, the second network card is as
  USB Ethernet adapter. (Thank you <a href=
  "http://sokolo.cronopios.org/">Michel</a>, for this example)</p>

  <h3>Operating System</h3>

  <p>Since Windows is not free you should use any GNU/Linux (which
  is free) for NaYaBoh. In fact NaYaBoh is NOT running on
  Windows.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is a very
  user-friendly version of Linux. So I recommend that you use it,
  since I also test NaYaBoh on it. You can download Ubuntu here:
  <a href=
  "http://www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/download">http://www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/download</a><br />

  It is best to use the LTS version (long term support).<br /></p>

  <p>If you are an experienced Linux user you can also try the
  Ubuntu server version or any Debian.<br /></p>

  <p><span style=
  "font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Important:</span><br />

  Since there is only one package for different Linux distributions
  it is always possible that there are problems.<br />
  For now I know the following issues and make the following
  recommendations:<br /></p>

  <ul>
    <li>NO PROBLEMS / RECOMMENDED: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS "Lucid" or
    Debian testing "Squeeze" <span style="font-style: italic;">(I
    recommend one of those )</span><br /></li>

    <li>INSTALLATION <a href=
    "https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/adzapper/+bug/658700">
    BUGS</a>: Ubuntu 10.10 "Maverick" <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">(this solves the problem: do "sudo touch
    /etc/init.d/squid" before package installation)</span></li>

    <li>GUI PROBLEMS: Debian stable "Lenny" <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">(concernes only gui - main package works
    fine)</span><br /></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>NaYaBoh</h3>

  <p>You can download NaYaBoh directly from where it is developed.
  Use this link: <a href=
  "https://sourceforge.net/projects/nayaboh/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/nayaboh/files/</a><br />

  There is an additional package called "nayaboh-gui" - it is
  optional to install and provides a small graphical user interface
  for some (but not all) functions of NaYaBoh.<br /></p>

  <p>Remember that there is no warranty of functionality. Make sure
  that you download the most recent version, since this is most
  likely the best one.</p>

  <h2>How do I install it?</h2>

  <p>First you need to make sure that you connect everything
  correctly.</p>

  <p>Your Internet router should give dynamic IP (DHCP), so that
  NaYaBoh will receive one automatically.</p>

  <p>It is not very simple to know which network card has to be
  pluged to the Internet and which to the local switch. I have no
  simple "howto" for now. Just try your luck and all your
  intelligence :-)</p>

  <div><img class="center" title="NaYaBoh_setup" src=
  "pics/nayaboh_setup.png" alt="Setup of NaYaBoh" /></div>
  <pre class="imgtxt">
Setup of NaYaBoh<br />
</pre>

  <p>Installing Ubuntu should be even more easy than installing
  Windows. Burn it on a CD and start the Computer using this CD.
  Then follow the instructions.</p>

  <p>Installing NaYaBoh is actually very simple. Just put the file
  which you have downloaded on as USB flash and drag it on the
  Ubuntu Desktop. A simple double click on the file should start
  the installation routine.</p>

  <p>If you have an error (concerning "dnsmasq") at the very
  beginning this is most likely because Ubuntu could not update
  it's available packages during the installation. To solve this
  open in the menu Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Terminal
  and type the following:</p>
  <pre class="code">
<code>sudo aptitude update</code>
</pre>

  <p>After pressing Enter you will be asked for your user password.
  The update should be done now (Internet required). If you are now
  asked to upgrade your system, don't do it, it will eat your
  Internet for nothing.</p>

  <p>Double click again the package to start the installation. The
  installation process also needs Internet, because he is
  downloading additional software. Actually it is downloading the
  main operating software, NaYaBoh just does the configuration.</p>

  <h3>Debian installation</h3>

  <p>Since Debian is a little different from Ubuntu (actually it's
  the other way round) and more for advanced system administrators,
  there are some things you need to know if you use NaYaBoh on
  Debian.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Install Package:</b> Use <code>gdebi</code> to install
    NaYaBoh, it will resolv all dependencies.</li>

    <li><b>User rights:</b> Some scripts need root priviledge. So
    either you run them as root or you configure your user as a
    sudoer. If you want to use the desktop menu you need to be in
    the sudoers file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How do I run it?</h2>

  <p>When you connect your computers over a switch to NaYaBoh make
  sure that they are configured to receive their network
  configuration by DHCP. In Windows you have to do it like in the
  picture.</p>

  <div><img class="center" title="winxptcpipdhcp" src=
  "http://i.technet.microsoft.com/Bb457086.tcpfig1%28en-us,TechNet.10%29.gif"
  alt="DHCP menu windows" height="341" width="303" /></div>
  <pre class="imgtxt">
Configure your Windows clients like this<br />
</pre>

  <p>Apart from that there is not much to do. The NaYaBoh machine
  just needs to be on.</p>
